# Senior research ideas

For each of the following ideas, I have a starting idea or initial
implementation.

## Artificial intelligence

### Git planner

### Student advisor

### American Sign Language tutor

## Programming languages

### Spoken programming language

### Visual homoiconic programming language

## Other ideas

Please talk to me if you have other ideas. Consider using some of the
following devices previously purchased for senior research:

- Fitbit Surge (fitness/health monitoring)
- iPod Touch (mobile apps)
- Kinect (interfaces, games)
- Muse headband (brainwave monitoring)
- 4-wheeled robot with arm gripper, two cameras, LIDAR (robotics)

The Math/CS department typically purchases more equipment upon request.
